# Prawn::Component

> ðŸš§ Under construction. More documentation to come  ðŸš§

Organizing content in Prawn gets notoriously difficult as the size and complexity of the document increases. This often leads to a junk drawer of helper methods and mixins that is hard to maintain.

Components are an antidote to this approach. They encapsulate a self-contained piece of content which can be drawn in any document. This makes them easy to test and reuse.

## Example
```ruby
class Box < Prawn::Component
  template do |component, content|
    bounding_box([0, cursor - 100], width: component.width, height: component.height) do
      content.call
      transparent(0.5) { stroke_bounds }
    end
  end

  attr_reader :width, :height

  def initialize(width: 100, height: 100)
    @width, @height = width, height
  end
end

Prawn::Document.generate("box.pdf") do
  component Box, width: 200, height: 100 do
    text "Inside the box"
  end
end
```
